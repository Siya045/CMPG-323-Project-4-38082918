## Robotic Process Automation and Testing
Testing is a crucial part of any solution and can be done from many different perspectives; internal development team testing, business user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. Many different types of testing can be conducted on a solution, and user acceptance testing is usually done manually. UAT is often included in most development lifecycles as a crucial step that acts as the ‘go/no-go’ decision maker. UAT is focused on ensuring that the input entered into the solution generates the expected output. Suppose the solution does not generate the desired output. In that case, the solution needs to be amended and retested as it would generally not be published to production unless it passes all tests in UAT. 

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call, ‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks. RPA not only improves efficiency and accuracy in business processes, but also spares human workers from needing to spend their time on dull and repetitive tasks. This frees them up to focus on work that requires human judgement and empathy. As discussed in the previous post in this series, RPA works by accessing information from your existing computer systems in much the same way as a human worker would. 

## What Are the Benefits of Using RPA
The benefits of RPA are wide-ranging and far-reaching. You can put software robots to work to achieve significant and measurable improvements in areas of your business that range from customer satisfaction and employee engagement through to process speed, accuracy and cost efficiency. The non-exhaustive list of the benefits of RPA include:

**Customer satisfaction:** By freeing up your customer-service personnel from forms and tabulations, you’re giving them more time for attentive customer service. The result is an improved customer experience and a much greater ability to meet the requirements of service-level agreements.

**Productivity:** Compared with humans, software robots can complete the same tasks about five times faster. They also work 24/7. Work will be getting done more quickly, which creates capacity for more work to get done. Higher productivity can reduce expenses as well as create room for more rapid growth.

**Accuracy:** Robots are 100 percent accurate, 100 percent consistent, and 100 percent compliant with policies. The more work you turn over to robots, the fewer clerical errors you experience, and the more time you save that used to be spent correcting those errors. Eliminating the little mistakes humans make can have an enormous culminative impact on your cost base and customer satisfaction levels.

**Resource utilization:** Offloading the mundane tasks to robots frees up your team to handle the tasks that add the most value to your business. What’s more, a robotic workforce is fully scalable, enabling organizations to respond to a spike in demand or a lull. That’s good for customer service and helps ease HR headaches.

RPA will almost certainly change your labor equation — but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be slashing full-time equivalents. Your human workforce will be freed from many routine, mundane tasks for which they’re overqualified. That leaves them bandwidth to tackle higher-value work.

**Return on investment (ROI):** You will start seeing rapid ROI when you switch on your robotic workforce, with operating costs generally dropping quickly. While some IT expenditures will make you wait months or years before ROI shows up, with RPA, you’ll begin seeing ROI in weeks.

**Reduced staffing headaches:** There’s nothing easy about staffing, especially in parts of your organization where the demand is uneven, activity levels are unpredictable, and turnover is high. Unlike the human workforce robots can be scaled up and down comparatively easily. They can be deployed quickly and much more cost-effectively. It’s a lot easier to have the right level of staff at the right time.

## How can Stake Holders User RPA to Realize and Maximize the Benefits Brought Upon by RPAs
Stakeholders can leverage Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to maximize business gains and ensure that automated projects are worth the investment by focusing on a strategic approach that emphasizes value-driven outcomes, integration, and proper governance. Here are key methods to achieve this:

*Identify High-Impact Areas for Automation*

Stakeholders should target processes that are highly repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. By automating these tasks, businesses can reduce costs, improve accuracy, and increase operational efficiency. For example, automating back-office functions such as data entry, invoice processing, and customer service queries can offer immediate returns on investment (ROI).

*Align Automation with Business Goals*

For RPA to deliver significant value, it needs to align with the overall business strategy. Stakeholders must ensure that automated processes contribute to larger goals such as customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and innovation. This alignment also makes it easier to measure success and demonstrate the value of RPA projects to the organization.

*Ensure Strong Governance and Compliance*

A well-structured governance framework is critical to the success of RPA implementations. This involves monitoring the deployment of bots, ensuring compliance with regulations, and managing risks effectively. Clear accountability structures should be established to oversee RPA projects, minimizing disruptions or failures during operations.

*Leverage Scalability*

Stakeholders should focus on scaling RPA efforts across the organization to maximize returns. Successful scaling involves automating more complex processes over time, integrating RPA with other technologies such as AI and machine learning, and expanding the use of automation across departments.

*Monitor and Measure Performance*

Regularly evaluating the performance of RPA initiatives is crucial to determine their ongoing value. Stakeholders should track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as cost savings, error reduction, and time improvements, and make necessary adjustments to optimize RPA’s effectiveness.

*Ensure Employee Involvement and Training*

For RPA to be successful, employees must be on board. Stakeholders should involve employees early in the automation process, ensuring they understand how RPA will enhance their roles rather than replace them. Offering training and reskilling opportunities can help employees transition to more strategic work, boosting job satisfaction and productivity.

*Focus on ROI and Continuous Improvement*

Automating processes should provide measurable ROI, and stakeholders should focus on iterative improvements. Automation is not a one-time deployment but requires continuous monitoring and enhancement to adapt to changing business needs and technology advancements.

By implementing these practices, stakeholders can harness the full potential of RPA to drive significant business gains, improve efficiency, and justify the investment in automation technology.
